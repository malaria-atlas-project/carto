<b>Population total:</b> The population in ${country_name} in 2010 totals ${pop_total?string("###,###,###,###")}
of which ${rural?string("###,###,###,###")} live in rural areas.

~<b>Derivation:</b> The GRUMP <i>beta</i> (http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/gpw) version provides gridded population counts at 1 x 1 km 
globally for the year 2000 adjusted to the United Nationsâ€™ national population estimates and an ancillary surface of 
urban extents. These were projected to the year 2010 by applying national, medium variant, urban and rural-specific 
growth rates (http://esa.un.org/unpp) to the relevant areas. This resulted in the 2010 population count surface shown, 
which was used to derive the population totals.
